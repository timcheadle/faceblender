# faceblender

I needed a montage of profile pictures for a web project I was working on. Sadly, I couldn't find anything to generate one for me, so I wrote this one.

## Installation

Just clone the repo and install necessary gems with `bundle`.

```
git clone git@github.com:timcheadle/faceblender.git
cd faceblender
bundle
```

## Usage

Just run the app.

```
./faceblender.rb
```

It will spit out an image called `faceblend.jpg`

## Thanks

Huge thanks @calebogden for making [UI Faces](http://uifaces.com) and everyone who contributed their photos!
